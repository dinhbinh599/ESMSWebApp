# ESMS
The web app of ESMS, Employee Skills Management System (ESMS for short) is a system that will help its users manage skills and speed up the process of finding suitable candidates for their projects.

# Product background
Human resources management is important and indispensable in the management of the activities of a commercial organization or enterprise. Human resources management helps managers be aware of the essential elements of the human factor in the operations of any organization or enterprise. Currently, many companies in Vietnam are managing the staff capacity according to each Curriculum Vitae, so the division of projects following the staff's capacity is usually arranged by HR. 
Even so, it is hard for HR to know if the candidates have the skills and talents suitable for various kinds of projects and dispense them appropriately due to having to manually search for employees and the limit of information in Curriculum Vitae. Additionally, HR software only manages closed profiles, which doesn’t allow PMs to directly take part in the searching process for their own projects, thus slow down the process even further without ensuring an effective result.
On the employee’s side, without an effective matching result, said employee might have to work on positions and projects that are not matched with their skill sets, which can prevent them from bringing out their full skill potential and passion into play, resulting in low-quality products and output in general.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
